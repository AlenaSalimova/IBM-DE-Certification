# Exercise 5 - Group by

The operator $group by, along with operators like $sum, $avg, $min, $max, allows us to perform grouping operations.

This aggregation pipeline prints the average marks across all subjects.

```	

db.marks.aggregate([
{
    "$group":{
        "_id":"$subject",
        "average":{"$avg":"$marks"}
        }
}
])
